As docus is [discontinued](https://github.com/nuxt-themes/docus/issues/1016), I wanted a new docs solution. Vitepress is nice but I love nuxt content's easy customizability. The Nuxt team did an incredible job building the Nuxt UI Pro Docs template, but it has a commercial license. So I made this in about a week.
